    <p>
      Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty, professionally known as Nicki Minaj, is an inspiration to many people who are influenced through
      her music and iconic personality. She has been one of the top female rappers in the US for decades and continues to make music that makes it to tops of charts.
      She uses flamboyant, colorful costumes and wigs to create different characters within her music and albums.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her music, aside from being fun,catchy, and sometimes nostalgic, radiates themes of self-confidence for people of all ages, genders, and backgrounds. 
      In a 2012 interview with Peter Robinson, Nicki was asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="hlight">"I like to think of your lyric "starships are meant to fly" as being a heartfelt line about 
        human beings not reaching their full potential in life. But is it just there to rhyme with "reach up and touch the sky"?</span>
    </p>
    <p>To which Nicki replied:</p>
    <p class="hlight">
      "No, that's exactly it! That's what I feel. Just go for it! Stop limiting yourself! And that's a great feeling. It's a great feeling to 
      not box yourself into anyone's limitations or ideas or judgments. That's what it means to me. So you were right!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicki's presence goes beyond crazy wigs, nostalgic memories, and chart-topping songs. She is a positive role model for her fans
      and is constantly preaching self love and respect, which I think is important for society.
    </p>
