            <p>Cat Bounce is a simple website in which you get to do exactly what the title implies-- bounce cats around. There are six 2-D images of cats on a gradient 
            background that are in constant motion. The user can choose to click and drag on any of the cats, launching it into any direction they choose. Pressing the "Make
            it Rain" button in the top right-hand corner makes a shower of cats quickly fall across the screen before disappearing.
            <br>Cat Bounce was created by Tara Sinn in 2012 using Javascript. On her informational page(which can be reached through the Cat Bounce website, Tara includes
            coding resouces and organizations that cat-lovers may donate to in order to help animals. Cat Bounce also won the 2019 People's Voice Webby Award for Weirdest 
            Website.</p>

            <p>Map Crunch is a website that takes you to a random street view via Google Street View. There is an Options panel that allows the user to filter results by country and 
                type of location. The user can use the white arrows to 'travel' down each street and explore just about any part of the world that has been
                recorded by Google Maps. There is also a gallery created by users that contains the most interesting or beautiful views found using the website.
            <br> Map Crunch was created by Nick Nicholaou who is an independent web developer who enjoys creating interesting websites. He has also worked as a full-stack developer for 
                many years. </p>

            <p>Quick Draw is an AI experiment in which the user tries to draw a specific object and a neural network tries to guess what they are drawing. Once the AI guesses the user's
                drawing, it displays a comparison to other users' drawings of that same object, as well as other objects that the AI detected in the user's drawing.
            <br>The developers, Jonas Jongejan, Henry Rowley, Takashi Kawashima, Jongmin Kim, and Nick Fox-Gieg, collaborated with Google developers to create the neural network. Initially,
                they trained it with a few hundred concepts, but they plan to add more. The AI uses each user interaction to make its image detection even better.</p>
