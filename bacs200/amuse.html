            <p>Cat Bounce is a simple website in which you get to do exactly what the title implies-- bounce cats around. There are six 2-D images of cats on a gradient 
            background that are in constant motion. The user can choose to click and drag on any of the cats, launching it into any direction they choose. Pressing the "Make
            it Rain" button in the top right-hand corner makes a shower of cats quickly fall across the screen before disappearing. </p>
            <p>Cat Bounce was created by Tara Sinn in 2012 using Javascript. On her informational page(which can be reached through the Cat Bounce website, Tara includes
            coding resouces and organizations that cat-lovers may donate to in order to help animals. Cat Bounce also won the 2019 People's Voice Webby Award for Weirdest 
            Website.</p>
