    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br>Introduction</span>
    <br>Hi, I’m Emma Ogle. I am currently studying Software Engineering at the University of
    Northern Colorado. I am currently a tutor for the Computer Science department for
    beginner coding classes. I enjoy helping students find and fix problems in their 
    code while also learning so much for myself. My hobbies have always been on the
    creative side. I have enjoyed drawing, painting, composing music, singing, and 
    performance throughout my life. There has always been a satisfaction that comes
     with creating something, which I have also experienced with software development. 
     <br>
    
     <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br>Background</span>
    <br>My professional background is actually in healthcare. I got my CNA license in 
    2019 while I was in high-school and have been working at a nursing home ever since. 
    Working in this field has really strengthened my skills in communication, time 
    management, and hard work. Although healthcare seems to be a rather unrelated field
    to technology, especially web development, there is a lot of room for advancement 
    and improvement as facilities modernize their systems for medical charting, food 
    services, and employee resources. Just from seeing the technology used at my facility, 
    I think that healthcare-specialized software for food services would be extremely useful.
    <br>
    
    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br>Skills</span>
    <br>In order to be a successful team member, one needs to be able to connect 
    effective communication with knowledge of their field. My background in healthcare 
    helps me to be people and communication-focused, and my current experience and education 
    in software engineering is teaching me technical skills.  My experience with tutoring 
    has been giving me a bridge between ‘people’ skills and technical skills. I think that 
    my five greatest skills are professional communication, diligence, organization, 
    creativity, and patience. 
    <br>
    
    <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br>Why Hire Me?</span>
    <br>I am a willing learner who strives to produce work that is organized as well 
    as functional. I always want my code to be readable and efficient, and understand 
    that learning goes far beyond the classroom. I consider myself a good team player 
    as I am always concerned with meeting and eventually exceeding expectations of my 
    teammates and supervisors. I think that my creativity and the satisfaction that 
    comes with creation and visual beauty will also help me to stay motivated, especially 
    on the front end of development.
