                    <h2>Using Social Media for Extremism</h2>
                    <p>
                        Social media is starting to become a key tool in the radicalization process of 
                        U.S. extremists. In 2016 alone, social media played a role for nearly 90% of the extremists in the PIRUS data.
                        The top three platforms most frequented by extremist based on data from 2005-2016 are: Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter.
                        The use of social media for extremism has social, economic, and political consequences. The question raised is: should social
                        media platforms, and potential the US government, use their resources to fight social media extremism, or is the problem not severe enough to address on a large scale?
    

                    </p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>After evaluating the following factors, it has been found that it is worth using social media platforms' and some of the government's 
                        resources to gradually ban social media extremism.

                    <h2>Social Implications of Allowing Social Media Extremism</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h3>Pros</h3></li>
                        <h4>Evidence and Accountability for Crimes</h4>
                        <p>If extremists are allowed to post on social media, it becomes easier for the police to 
                            find culprits when crimes are committed. An especially easy crime to pinpoint would be threats. 
                            If extremists are banned from social media, hate crimes may be harder to solve.
                        </p>

                        <li><h3>Cons</h3></li>
                        <h4>Increase in Crime</h4>
                        <p>Extremists use social media to recruit and influence people to their cause. These pockets of radicalized social media users 
                            have a negative impact on society, because these extreme ideas may contain talk of violence and discrimination. 
                            Exposure and brainwashing under these ideas may cause impressionable people groups to act in violent ways or commit hate crimes.
                            The increase in crime caused by these ideas are a major consequence that society faces due to social media extremism.
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                    <p>Although evidence would be more readily avialable if extremists were allowed to post on social media,
                        exterme ideas would not spread rapidly to vulnerable people groups if they were not allowed to post in the 
                        first place. Therefore, in terms of social implications, it is worth social media and maybe even government
                        resources to combat social media extremism.

                    <h2>Economic Implications of Allowing Social Media Extremism</h2>

                        <li><h3>Pros</h3></li>
                        <h4>Resources Better Spent</h4>
                        <p>If social media companies do not spend excess amounts of resources stopping extremists, there will
                            be more money to spend in more pressing areas such as paying their employees, advertisements, and 
                            developing a better user experience. Likewise, the government could better use this money for infrastructure,
                            the healthcare system, etc.
                        </p>
                        <li><h3>Cons</h3></li>
                        <h4>Major Economic Loss if Extremism is Allowed</h4>
                        <p>According to a 2020 study in the journal Peace Economics, Peace Science, and Public Policy,
                            the economic impact of terrorism and extremism is estimated at $US 33 Billion in 2018 alone. The 
                            four indicators that caused such an economic impact are terrorism-related deaths, injuries, property damages, and 
                            GDP losses.
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>      
                    <p> Social media extremists often lead to terrorism, so it would be well worth it to spend money 
                        in order to decrease these economic losses.It is not worth the billions of dollars lost on
                        loss of lives and the property damage to ignore social media extremism.</p>

                    <h2>Political Implications of Allowing Social Media Extremsism</h2>

                        <li><h3>Pros</h3></li>
                        <h4>Freedom of Speech</h4>
                        <p>
                            Eliminating those who post extremist-related content on social media on a government scale 
                            would be against the spirit of the First Amendment. The First Amendment guarantees the freedom
                            of expression by prohibiting laws that impose on the rights of an individual to speak freely. 
                        </p>
                        <li><h3>Cons</h3></li>
                        <h4>National Security and Policial Party Tension</h4>
                        <p>
                            Those who contribute to the growth of extremist ideas may cause an uprising against the government. This 
                            is a threat to America as a country and goes against many laws. Social media extremism may also lead to
                            further polarization of the two major political parties, meaning that both rightists and leftist may lean
                            even further apart towards extremism. This would create even more tension and hatred between political parties.
                        </p>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Since safety as a nation is currently a more pressing matter than a slight restriction on the freedom of speech,
                        it would be better for the US government to push towards eliminating social media extremism. Furthermore, if the government 
                        creates no actual legislation against social media extremism but rather gives resources to help social media companies 
                        regulate their content, the First Amendment is not even technically violated.
