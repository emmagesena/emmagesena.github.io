        <h2>The Effects of Online Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Due to the pandemic, online learning has been popularized through necessity in the past two years. Since many students have 
            been exposed to online learning as of recently, it is much easier to see the benefits and challenges associated with online learning. 
            <br>
            The main advantage of online learning is the flexibility of location. This factor was a saving grace when it came to the pandemic. 
            With online learning, students do not have to worry about commuting to school. They have more flexibility when it comes to choosing a college. 
            Online learning is more compatible with students who work part-time or full-time, are parents, or simply want to save money with their 
            living situation. Some online classes are also flexible meeting-wise, which allows students to learn and complete their work at their own pace. 
            Online learning also allows teachers to find creative ways to teach their material. Oftentimes, learning is presented in multiple ways that 
            allow students to pick the style of learning that suits them best.  
            <br>
            There are many challenges that come with online learning as well, the first being inequitable access to technology. Some students may not even 
            have computers, or have computers that cannot handle certain software. There are also limitations to technology. Breakdowns can occur at any point 
            in the delivery system and cause the class to be delayed. For some students, online learning, especially a Zoom classroom, can feel very disconnected 
            and can make them feel unfocused or distracted. Online learning can also affect mental health, since no real human connection is made. Students may 
            feel lonely or disconnected when participating in online learning. 
            <br>
            There are a lot of challenges that come with globalization, but as more and more companies move towards globalization, the future of 
            the world is affected and has no choice but to face these challenges in order to reap the benefits. These benefits and challenges of 
            globalization affect web development business just as much as other businesses, if not more rapidly due to many employees being online.
            <br>
            Online learning can be convenient, but oftentimes the quality of learning is compromised when it comes to online classes, especially for more hands-on 
            subjects.  In terms of web development, many new and upcoming web-developers may have received online learning versus traditional learning, 
            and the effects of online learning may come into play when they enter the professional world.
