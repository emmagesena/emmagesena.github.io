        <h2>The Effect of Globalization on Web Development</h2>
        <p>
            As technology advances, globalization occurs. Globalization is the process of interaction and integration among people, companies, 
            and governments worldwide.Globalization affects web development in many ways. 
            <br>
            It aids in the spread of technology and the sharing of cultures. The costs of products become lower. With globalization, developing 
            countries experience a higher standard of living. There is access to new markets and new talents. 
            <br>
            However, along with many benefits, globalization presents several challenges. International recruiting and having international 
            employees can prove to be difficult, making HR departments less efficient. Unwanted tariffs and export fees also come into play with 
            the globalization of companies. Cheap labor sources also may exploit foreign workers.  Globalization may change the expectations of
            international employees as well as creating marketing changes and increased competition. Some  also believe that globalization may 
            erase local cultural identity. 
            <br>
            There are a lot of challenges that come with globalization, but as more and more companies move towards globalization, the future of 
            the world is affected and has no choice but to face these challenges in order to reap the benefits. These benefits and challenges of 
            globalization affect web development business just as much as other businesses, if not more rapidly due to many employees being online.
