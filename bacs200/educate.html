       <td>Behind the everyday bargains we all love -- the $10 manicure, the unlimited shrimp buffet --
            is a hidden world of forced labor to keep those prices at rock bottom.
             Noy Thrupkaew investigates human trafficking – which flourishes in the US and Europe,
              as well as developing countries – and shows us the human
            faces behind the exploited labor that feeds global consumers.</td>

           the mind, tap into the heart and bring light in the darkest times. Take a deep breath

            African artifacts shown in museums worldwide are often not borrowed, but stolen 
            -- and TED Fellow Jim Chuchu is on a mission to get them back. Learn the sordid 
            history behind how many of the collections in the West came to be, Chuchu's extensive 
            work tracking and restoring Kenya's cultural heritage and what these efforts can mean 
            for the wider African continent. An urgent call for institutions to reconsider the morality 
            of the objects they "own" and their significance to the communities from which they were taken.
